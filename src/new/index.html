				<li><b>About Me:</b></li>
				<div id="about-me">
					I Love free (<i>as in freedom</i>) open source software and community driven projects. Some of my favorite software is made by <a href="https;//suckless.org/">Suckless Software</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html">the GNU collection</a>. I value privacy over everything, I despise subscription services. The modern digital world is a mess, having to navigate mass surveillance, censorship and the ever-increasing overabundance of artificial intelligence. Put the power back into the hands of the people.
					<br><br>
					I've been using technology for as long as I can remeber, along with this I've always been a fan of unix based operating systems like Linux and BSD. Over the last few months I've started daily-driving FreeBSD for development with a dualbooted ArchLinux machine for bsd-non-compatable software like steam. I am familiar with majority of linux distros and now most of the "popular" BSD varients. some of these include, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop_OS, Manjaro, Arch Linux, Crux Linux, Parabola Linux, Slackware, SalixOS, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Debian and more. 
					<br><br> 
					<li><b>My Setup</b></li>
					As stated before, I'm a big fan of <a href="https://suckless.org">Suckless software</a>. My main setup consists of their <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">Dynamic Window Manager or DWM</a>, along with this I use the <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">ST terminal</a> and the <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu">Dynamic Menu or DMENU launcher</a>. These tools in my opinion increase my productivity and of course make my desktop look pretty.

				<div id="history">
					I Been writing code for around five years now, if you think thats not very long keep in mind I was born in 2008. I first started out writing basic programs in python. I got hooked onto software development so I have lots of experience with popular python gui librarys like Tkinter, CustomTkinter, ImGUI and more. After a while I started looking into web development using the javascript Electron framework, this of course drove me to learn web development. For a long time I practiced web development until I was profficient in javascript, I never bothered learning a framework like React or Svelt as I'm a strong beliver in semantic modularization of elements in html. After that stage I started getting into linux and other FOSS operating systems, this drove me to learn the C programming language in which I've made several projects below.
