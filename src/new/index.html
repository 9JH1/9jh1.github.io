				<li><b>About Me:</b></li>
				<div id="about-me">
					I Love free (<i>as in freedom</i>) open source software and community driven projects. Some of my favorite software is made by <a href="https;//suckless.org/">Suckless Software</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html">the GNU collection</a>. I value privacy over everything, I despise subscription services. The modern digital world is a mess, having to navigate mass surveillance, censorship and the ever-increasing overabundance of artificial intelligence. Put the power back into the hands of the people.
					<br><br>
					My production setup consists of a FreeBSD base with DWM. Try my config <a href="https://github.com/9jh1/dwm-rice">here</a>

				<div id="history">
					I Been writing code for around five years now, if you think thats not very long keep in mind I was born in 2008. I first started out writing basic programs in python. I got hooked onto software development so I have lots of experience with popular python gui librarys like Tkinter, CustomTkinter, ImGUI and more. After a while I started looking into web development using the javascript Electron framework, this of course drove me to learn web development. For a long time I practiced web development until I was profficient in javascript, I never bothered learning a framework like React or Svelt as I'm a strong beliver in semantic modularization of elements in html. After that stage I started getting into linux and other FOSS operating systems, this drove me to learn the C programming language in which I've made several projects below.
